# Rabuste Coffee – Experience-Driven Café Website

Rabuste Coffee is a bold, grab-and-go specialty café concept focused exclusively on premium Robusta coffee. The café blends coffee culture with art, workshops, and community-driven experiences, creating a compact yet scalable hospitality model.

This project is a frontend-first prototype developed for **Google Winter of Code (GWOC)** under the *Experience-Based Local Business* track.
